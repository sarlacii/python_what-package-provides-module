# python_what-package-provides-module
Without getting confused, there are tons of questions online about installing python packages, how to import the resulting modules, and listing what packages are available. But there doesn't seem to be the equivalent of a "--what-provides" option for pip, if you don't have a requirements.txt or pipenv. This question is similar to previous forum questions, but asks for the parent package, and not additional metadata. That said, these other questions do not get a lot of attention or many accepted answers - eg. How do you find python package metadata information given a module on StackOverflow. So forging ahead... I came up with a rough-and-ready method.
